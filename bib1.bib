	abstract = {Objectives
We provide guidelines for handling the most common missing data problems in repeated measurements in observational studies and deal with practicalities in producing imputations when there are many partly missing time-varying variables and repeated measurements.
Study Design and Setting
The Maastricht Study on long-term dementia care environments was used as a case study. The data contain 84 momentary assessments for each of 115 participants. A continuous outcome and several time-varying covariates were involved containing missing observations varying from 4\% to 25\% per time point. A multiple imputation procedure is advocated with restrictions imposed on the relation within and between partially missing variables over time.
Results
Multiple imputation is a better approach to deal with missing observations in both outcome and independent variables. Furthermore, using the statistical package R-MICE, it is possible to deal with the limitations of current statistical software in imputation of missing observations in more complex data.
Conclusion
In observational studies, the direct likelihood approach (i.e., the standard longitudinal data methods) is sufficient to obtain valid inferences in the presence of missing data only in the outcome. In contrast, multiple imputation is required when dealing with partly missing time-varying covariates and repeated measurements.},

When implementing MI, however, users need to make important decisions to obtain estimates with good statistical properties. One such decision involves the choice of imputation model–the joint modeling (JM) versus fully conditional specification (FCS) approach. Another involves the choice of method to handle interactions. These include imputing the interaction term as any other variable (active imputation), or imputing the main effects and then deriving the interaction (passive imputation). Our study investigates the best approach to perform MI in the presence of interaction effects involving two categorical variables. Such effects warrant special attention as they involve multiple correlated parameters that are handled differently under JM and FCS modeling. Through an extensive simulation study, we compared active, passive and an improved passive approach under FCS, as JM precludes passive imputation. We additionally compared JM and FCS techniques using active imputation. Performance between active and passive imputation was comparable. The improved passive approach proved superior to the other two particularly when the number of parameters corresponding to the interaction was large. JM without rounding and FCS using active imputation were also mostly comparable, with JM outperforming FCS when the number of parameters was large. In a direct comparison of JM active and FCS improved passive, the latter was the clear winner. We recommend improved passive imputation under FCS along with sensitivity analyses to handle multi-level interaction terms.},

With the aim of providing an imputation method which preserves interactions in the data automatically, the use of recursive partitioning as imputation method is examined. Three recursive partitioning techniques are implemented in the multiple imputation by chained equations framework. It is investigated, using simulated data, whether recursive partitioning creates appropriate variability between imputations and unbiased parameter estimates with appropriate confidence intervals. It is concluded that, when interaction effects are present in a dataset, substantial gains are possible by using recursive partitioning for imputation compared to standard applications. In addition, it is shown that the potential of recursive partitioning imputation approaches depends on the relevance of a possible interaction effect, the correlation structure of the data, and the type of possible interaction effect present in the data.},

With complete data, this could be achieved using the gain in prediction test, hierarchical multiple regression, or an omnibus F test. However, in substantive research scenarios, missing data often exist. In the context of multiple imputation, one of the current state-of-art missing data strategies, there are several different analogous multi-parameter tests of the joint significance of a set of parameters, and these multi-parameter test statistics can be referenced to various distributions to make statistical inferences. However, little is known about the performance of these tests, and virtually no research study has compared the Type 1 error rates and statistical power of these tests in scenarios that are typical of behavioral science data (e.g., small to moderate samples, etc.). This paper uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to examine the performance of these multi-parameter test statistics for multiple imputation under a variety of realistic conditions. We provide a number of practical recommendations for substantive researchers based on the simulation results, and illustrate the calculation of these test statistics with an empirical example.},

	abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is now well established as a flexible, general, method for the analysis of data sets with missing values. Most implementations assume the missing data are `missing at random' (MAR), that is, given the observed data, the reason for the missing data does not depend on the unseen data. However, although this is a helpful and simplifying working assumption, it is unlikely to be true in practice. Assessing the sensitivity of the analysis to the MAR assumption is therefore important. However, there is very limited MI software for this. Further, analysis of a data set with missing values that are not missing at random (NMAR) is complicated by the need to extend the MAR imputation model to include a model for the reason for dropout. Here, we propose a simple alternative. We first impute under MAR and obtain parameter estimates for each imputed data set. The overall NMAR parameter estimate is a weighted average of these parameter estimates, where the weights depend on the assumed degree of departure from MAR. In some settings, this approach gives results that closely agree with joint modelling as the number of imputations increases. In others, it provides ball-park estimates of the results of full NMAR modelling, indicating the extent to which it is necessary and providing a check on its results. We illustrate our approach with a small simulation study, and the analysis of data from a trial of interventions to improve the quality of peer review.},

Thus, the primary goal of this manuscript is to describe and illustrate the application of multiple imputation. Although maximum likelihood estimation is perhaps the easiest method to use in practice, psychological data sets often feature complexities that are currently difficult to handle appropriately in the likelihood framework (e.g., mixtures of categorical and continuous variables), but relatively simple to treat with imputation. The paper describes a number of practical issues that clinical researchers are likely to encounter when applying multiple imputation, including mixtures of categorical and continuous variables, item-level missing data in questionnaires, significance testing, interaction effects, and multilevel missing data.

	abstract = {Purpose
The aim of this research was to examine, in an exploratory manner, whether cross-sectional multiple imputation generates valid parameter estimates for a latent growth curve model in a longitudinal data set with nonmonotone missingness.
Methods
A simulated longitudinal data set of N = 5000 was generated and consisted of a continuous dependent variable, assessed at three measurement occasions and a categorical time-invariant independent variable. Missing data had a nonmonotone pattern and the proportion of missingness increased from the initial to the final measurement occasion (5\%–20\%). Three methods were considered to deal with missing data: listwise deletion, full-information maximum likelihood, and multiple imputation. A latent growth curve model was specified and analysis of variance was used to compare parameter estimates between the full data set and missing data approaches.
Results
Multiple imputation resulted in significantly lower slope variance compared with the full data set. There were no differences in any parameter estimates between the multiple imputation and full-information maximum likelihood approaches.
Conclusions
This study suggested that in longitudinal studies with nonmonotone missingness, cross-sectional imputation at each time point may be viable and produces estimates comparable with those obtained with full-information maximum likelihood. Future research pursuing the validity of this method is warranted.},

	abstract = {Objective
Missing data are a pervasive problem, often leading to bias in complete records analysis (CRA). Multiple imputation (MI) via chained equations is one solution, but its use in the presence of interactions is not straightforward.
Study Design and Setting
We simulated data with outcome Y dependent on binary explanatory variables X and Z and their interaction XZ. Six scenarios were simulated (Y continuous and binary, each with no interaction, a weak and a strong interaction), under five missing data mechanisms. We use directed acyclic graphs to identify when CRA and MI would each be unbiased. We evaluate the performance of CRA, MI without interactions, MI including all interactions, and stratified imputation. We also illustrated these methods using a simple example from the National Child Development Study (NCDS).
Results
MI excluding interactions is invalid and resulted in biased estimates and low coverage. When XZ was zero, MI excluding interactions gave unbiased estimates but overcoverage. MI including interactions and stratified MI gave equivalent, valid inference in all cases. In the NCDS example, MI excluding interactions incorrectly concluded there was no evidence for an important interaction.

	abstract = {The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is frequently used to examine whether a number of groups differ on a variable of interest. The global hypothesis test of the ANOVA can be reformulated as a regression model in which all group differences are simultaneously tested against zero. Multiple imputation offers reliable and effective treatment of missing data; however, recommendations differ with regard to what procedures are suitable for pooling ANOVA results from multiply imputed datasets. In this article, we compared several procedures (known as D1, D2, and D3) using Monte Carlo simulations. Even though previous recommendations have advocated that D2 should be avoided in favor of D1 or D3, our results suggest that all procedures provide a suitable test of the ANOVA’s global null hypothesis in many plausible research scenarios. In more extreme settings, D1 was most reliable, whereas D2 and D3 suffered from different limitations. We provide guidelines on how the different methods can be applied in one- and two-factorial ANOVA designs and information about the conditions under which some procedures may perform better than others.

	abstract = {Objectives
Researchers are concerned whether multiple imputation (MI) or complete case analysis should be used when a large proportion of data are missing. We aimed to provide guidance for drawing conclusions from data with a large proportion of missingness.
Study Design and Setting
Via simulations, we investigated how the proportion of missing data, the fraction of missing information (FMI), and availability of auxiliary variables affected MI performance. Outcome data were missing completely at random or missing at random (MAR).
Results
Provided sufficient auxiliary information was available; MI was beneficial in terms of bias and never detrimental in terms of efficiency. Models with similar FMI values, but differing proportions of missing data, also had similar precision for effect estimates. In the absence of bias, the FMI was a better guide to the efficiency gains using MI than the proportion of missing data.
Conclusion
We provide evidence that for MAR data, valid MI reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large. We advise researchers to use FMI to guide choice of auxiliary variables for efficiency gain in imputation analyses, and that sensitivity analyses including different imputation models may be needed if the number of complete cases is small.},

	abstract = {Currently, a growing number of programs become available in statistical software for multiple imputation of missing values. Among others, two algorithms are mainly implemented: Expectation Maximization (EM) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). They have been shown to work well in large samples or when only small proportions of missing data are to be imputed. However, some researchers have begun to impute large proportions of missing data or to apply the method to small samples. A simulation was performed using MICE on datasets with 50, 100 or 200 cases and four or eleven variables. A varying proportion of data (3\% - 63\%) was set as missing completely at random and subsequently substituted using multiple imputation by chained equations. In a logistic regression model, four coefficients, i.e. non-zero and zero main effects as well as non-zero and zero interaction effects were examined. Estimations of all main and interaction effects were unbiased. There was a considerable variance in the estimates, increasing with the proportion of missing data and decreasing with sample size. The imputation of missing data by chained equations is a useful tool for imputing small to moderate proportions of missing data. The method has its limits, however. In small samples, there are considerable random errors for all effects.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/usug11/23.html},
	abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is known as an effective method for handling missing data. However, it is not clear that the method will be effective when the data contain a high percentage of missing observations on a variable. This study examines the effectiveness of MI in data with 10\% to 80\% missing observations using absolute bias and root mean squared error of MI measured under missing completely at random, missing at random, and not missing at random assumptions. Using both simulated data drawn from multivariate normal distribution and example data from the Predictive Study of Coronary Heart Disease, the bias and root mean squared error using MI are much smaller than of the results when complete case analysis is used. In addition, the bias of MI is consistent regardless of increasing imputation numbers (M) from M = 10 to M = 50. Moreover, compared to the regression method and predictive mean matching method, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method can also be used for continuous and univariate missing variables as an imputation mechanism. In conclusion, MI produces less-biased estimates, but when large proportions of data are missing, other things need to be considered such as the number of imputations, imputation mechanisms, and missing data mechanisms for proper imputation.},

Prior studies have either compared methods for small samples with monotone missingness commonly found in longitudinal studies or have investigated the performance of a single method to handle arbitrary missingness with small samples but studies have yet to compare the relative performance of commonly implemented missing data methods for small samples with arbitrary missingness. This study conducts a simulation study to compare and assess the small sample performance of maximum likelihood, listwise deletion, joint multiple imputation, and fully conditional specification multiple imputation for a single-level regression model with a continuous outcome. Results showed that, provided assumptions are met, joint multiple imputation unanimously performed best of the methods examined in the conditions under study.},
